This is **very good thinking** 👍 — and it actually *fits perfectly* with the BRD/FDD we produced.
What you’ve added is mainly:

* **Corporate / Commercial Lending focus**
* **Officer-driven initiation (not only self-service)**
* **Human-in-the-loop AI**
* **Committee workflow + PDF pack generation**
* **Director / Signatory credit vetting**
* **Audited financials ingestion**

So instead of replacing the earlier design, we **extend and sync it**.
Below is the **synchronized architecture and process flow** that merges both ideas cleanly.

---

# 1. System Modes (Two Entry Paths)

The platform now supports **two primary modes**:

## Mode A – Retail / Self-Service (Earlier Design)

* Customer applies online.
* Mostly automated decisioning.
* Smaller ticket loans.

## Mode B – Corporate / Officer-Driven (Your New Flow)

* Loan Officer initiates.
* Heavy documentation.
* Committee approval.
* AI is **Decision Support**, not final authority.

This is actually ideal — one platform, two lending paradigms.

---

# 2. Updated High-Level Workflow (Corporate Lending)

## Step 1 – Loan Officer Initiation (Intranet Portal)

**New Module:** `CorporateLoanInitiation`

Inputs:

* Corporate Account Number
* Loan Amount
* Interest Rate Type (Per Annum / Monthly / Flat / Reducing)
* Tenor
* Loan Product

System Actions:

* Validate account existence via Core Banking API
* Create `LoanApplicationCase` with status = `Draft`

---

## Step 2 – Automatic Core Banking Data Pull

**Integration:** Fineract / Core Banking Adapter

Pulled Data Stored in Portal DB:

### 2.1 Corporate Profile

* Company Name
* Registration Number
* Industry
* Incorporation Date

### 2.2 Directors

* Full Name
* BVN
* Address
* Contact Info

### 2.3 Signatories

* Same fields as directors
* Mandate Types

### 2.4 Account Statement (6 Months)

* Transactions
* Inflows / Outflows
* Average Balance
* Turnover Ratio

**Design Update:**
Create entity `CorporateParty` with sub-types:

* Director
* Signatory
* Beneficial Owner (optional later)

---

## Step 3 – External Document Uploads

Loan Officer Uploads:

### 3.1 Other Bank Statements

* PDF / CSV
* Parser + Cashflow analytics

### 3.2 Audited Financials (3 Years)

* Balance Sheet
* Income Statement
* Cash Flow Statement

**New Module:** `FinancialDocumentAnalyzer`

* OCR + Table Extraction
* Financial Ratios:

  * Current Ratio
  * Debt-Equity
  * Net Profit Margin
  * EBITDA Margin

---

## Step 4 – Branch Level Approval

Workflow State: `BranchReview`

Branch Officer Options:

* Approve for Processing
* Return for Editing
* Reject

Audit Log Required.

---

## Step 5 – Credit Bureau Checks (After Branch Approval)

### External Integrations

* FirstCentral
* CreditRegistry
* (Optional Aggregator)

Checks Run On:

* Each Director
* Each Signatory

Output:

* Bureau Score
* Delinquency Records
* Active Loans
* Legal Flags

Stored as `IndividualCreditReport`.

---

## Step 6 – AI Decision Support (Not Auto Approval)

**Important Alignment:**
AI is **Advisory**, not authoritative.

### AI Responsibilities

1. Generate Score Matrix:

   * Corporate Financial Ratios
   * Cashflow Stability
   * Bureau Risk of Directors
   * Existing Bank Exposure
2. Suggest:

   * Recommended Loan Amount
   * Interest Tier
   * Repayment Schedule
   * Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
3. Generate:

   * Risk Commentary
   * Strengths / Weaknesses
   * Red Flags

### Output Format

* Dashboard View
* Exportable PDF
* Versioned Snapshot

**New Module:** `AIAdvisoryEngine`

---

## Step 7 – Head Office / Committee Workflow

Workflow States:

* `HOReview`
* `CommitteeCirculation`
* `FinalDecision`

Features:

* Comment Threads
* Voting (Approve / Decline / Modify)
* Document Attachment
* Digital Signatures

---

## Step 8 – Consolidated PDF Generation

**New Module:** `LoanPackGenerator`

Includes:

* Application Summary
* Financial Ratios
* Credit Bureau Reports
* AI Score Matrix
* Committee Comments
* Final Decision Page

Export to PDF → Print → Management Sign-off.

---

## Step 9 – Final Approval Trigger

Once final authority approves:

System Triggers:

* Notification to Branch
* Core Banking Loan Booking
* Disbursement
* Repayment Schedule Sync

Workflow State → `Disbursed`

# 5. Compliance & Risk Strength

* Governance and auditability

This is **exactly how Tier-1 commercial banks structure corporate credit**.

---

# 6. Resulting System Character

The merged design becomes:

**“An AI-Augmented Credit Governance Platform”**

Not just a loan portal, but a **full credit decision ecosystem**.

It now supports:

* Retail Automation
* SME Semi-Automation
* Corporate Committee Lending

Which means your platform scales from ₦50,000 microloans to ₦5B corporate facilities without redesign.
