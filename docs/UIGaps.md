# CRMS Intranet UI - Gap Analysis

**Document Version:** 4.9
**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Priority 1 RESOLVED | Priority 2 RESOLVED | Priority 3 RESOLVED

---

## Executive Summary

Following the 2026-02-18 gap analysis, significant progress has been made. The core data entry workflow (Collateral, Guarantors, Documents, Financial Statements) is now functional. Workflow transitions work correctly. Financial statement validation supports businesses of all ages. Document verification/rejection and collateral valuation/approval are now also complete.

## 2. Remaining Issues (Priority 2)

### 2.1 Collateral Management - ✅ Complete

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Add collateral | ✅ Done | Via modal |
| Edit collateral | ✅ Done | Via modal (Proposed/UnderValuation status only) |
| Delete collateral | ✅ Done | Confirmation modal (Proposed status only) |
| View collateral detail | ✅ Done | Full detail modal including valuation, lien, insurance, documents |
| Set valuation | ✅ Done | `SetCollateralValuationModal` — market value, FSV, haircut %, live acceptable value calc |
| Approve collateral | ✅ Done | Confirmation modal, calls `ApproveCollateralAsync` |
| Upload collateral documents | ✅ Done | `UploadCollateralDocumentModal`; upload button in CollateralTab (Draft or review stages) |
| View collateral documents | ✅ Done | View/download buttons in `ViewCollateralModal` DOCUMENTS section |
| Delete collateral documents | ✅ Done | Confirmation dialog; deletes both DB record and file from storage |

`CanManageValuation` is `true` when the application is actively in review (not Draft, Approved, CommitteeApproved, Rejected, or Disbursed).

**Collateral Document Access Control:**
- Upload/Delete available: Draft, BranchReview, HOReview, CreditAnalysis, FinalApproval
- Upload/Delete NOT available: Approved, CommitteeApproved, Rejected, Disbursed

### 2.2 Guarantor Management - ✅ Core Complete

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Add guarantor | ✅ Done | Via modal |
| Edit guarantor | ✅ Done | Via modal |
| Delete guarantor | ✅ Done | Confirmation modal |
| View guarantor detail | ✅ Done | Full detail modal |
| Approve guarantor | ✅ Done | Confirmation modal; `CanManageGuarantors` gate; status `CreditCheckCompleted` only |
| Reject guarantor | ✅ Done | Modal with mandatory reason; statuses `Proposed`, `PendingVerification`, `CreditCheckCompleted` |
| Run credit check | N/A | Auto-triggered after branch approval via `ProcessLoanCreditChecksCommand` |
| View credit report | ✅ Done | `ViewBureauReportModal` — full detail with accounts, fraud risk, alerts (Session 24) |

`CanManageGuarantors` is `true` when the application is actively in review (not Draft, Approved, CommitteeApproved, Rejected, or Disbursed).

### 2.3 Document Management - ✅ Complete

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Upload | ✅ Done | Via modal |
| View | ✅ Done | PDF/image preview |
| Download | ✅ Done | File download |
| Verify | ✅ Done | Inline button; calls `VerifyDocumentAsync` |
| Reject | ✅ Done | Modal with reason textarea; calls `RejectDocumentAsync` |

**Note on status display:** The domain creates documents with `DocumentStatus.Uploaded` but the UI displays this as "Pending" (via `FormatStatus()` in `DocumentsTab.razor`). Both "Uploaded" and "Pending" strings trigger the verify/reject buttons.

### 2.4 Credit Bureau Checks - ✅ Complete

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| List bureau reports | ✅ Done | Fetches real data from DB; grouped by party type |
| Business credit reports | ✅ Done | Separate section with distinct styling |
| Fraud risk display | ✅ Done | Color-coded badges (Low/Medium/High) |
| Party grouping | ✅ Done | Directors, Signatories, Guarantors in separate sections |
| New metrics | ✅ Done | Total Overdue, Max Delinquency Days, Provider name |
| Failed check indicator | ✅ Done | Shows "Check Failed" badge for failed reports |
| Request check | ⏸️ On Hold | Manual re-check button not needed — auto-triggered after branch approval |
| View report detail | ✅ Done | `ViewBureauReportModal` — click any card to see full detail (Session 24) |

### 2.5 Directors/Signatories Management - ✅ Core Complete

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| List parties | ✅ Done | PartiesTab displays directors and signatories |
| Add director/signatory | N/A — Not needed | Auto-fetched from core banking at application creation |
| Fill null BVN / shareholding % | ✅ Done | `FillPartyInfoModal` — shows only missing fields; Draft status only |
| Run bureau check | ⏸️ On Hold | Pending credit bureau provider decision |

**Confirmed (2026-02-20):** `InitiateCorporateLoanCommand` automatically calls `GetDirectorsAsync(customer.CustomerId)` and `GetSignatoriesAsync(accountNumber)` at application creation, populating all parties as `LoanApplicationParty` records. No "Add Director" or "Add Signatory" modals are needed — the PartiesTab is intentionally read-only for structure.

**Added (2026-03-01):** When core banking returns null BVN or shareholding %, a "Complete info" warning button appears in the row (Draft only). `FillPartyInfoModal` collects only the null fields and calls `UpdatePartyInfoAsync`.

### 2.6 Bank Statement Management - ✅ Complete

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Auto-fetch on application create | ✅ Done | `InitiateCorporateLoanCommand` persists CoreBanking statement (6-month) on create |
| View own-bank statement | ✅ Done | `StatementsTab` — Own Bank section with trust badge, cashflow metrics |
| Upload external statement | ✅ Done | `UploadExternalStatementModal` — bank name, account, period, balances |
| Verify external statement | ✅ Done | Inline button; calls `VerifyStatementAsync`; trust weight → 85% |
| Reject external statement | ✅ Done | Reason modal; calls `RejectStatementAsync` |
| Trigger cashflow analysis | ✅ Done | "Analyze" button per statement; calls `AnalyzeStatementAsync` |
| Cashflow metrics display | ✅ Done | Credits, Debits, Avg Balance, Net Cashflow, Bounced/Gambling tx counts |
| View individual transactions | ✅ Done | `ViewStatementModal` — filter (All/Credits/Debits), live search, color-coded category badges, recurring badge, negative balance highlight |

"View" button added to own-bank card and every external statement row in `StatementsTab`. `Detail.razor` wired. No backend changes needed — `GetStatementTransactionsHandler` was already registered in DI. Build: 0 errors. |
| 3.7 | 2026-03-16 | Location hierarchy + visibility filtering: `Location` aggregate (4-level: HO→Region→Zone→Branch), `VisibilityScope` enum, `VisibilityService` domain service, `LocationRepository`, EF migration `AddLocationHierarchy`, seed data (21 Nigeria locations). `ApplicationUser.LocationId` replaces `BranchId`. Query handlers filter by visibility scope. `UserInfo.LocationId`/`PrimaryRole` added. `ApplicationService.GetApplicationsByStatusAsync` visibility-aware overload. Applications Index passes user context. Pending: Location admin page, user location picker. Build: 0 errors. |
| 3.8 | 2026-03-16 | Location/visibility bug fixes (8 bugs + 2 gaps): BUG-1 UserInfo.LocationId populated; BUG-2 new apps get user's branch; BUG-3 UserDto.BranchId→LocationId renamed; BUG-4 GetHierarchyTreeAsync builds tree; BUG-5 UpdateUserCommand has LocationId; BUG-6 API endpoint uses visibility; BUG-7 GetPendingBranchReviewHandler registered in Infrastructure DI; BUG-8 VisibilityService documented; GAP-2 test users seeded with locations (6 users, default pwd Test@123); GAP-5 NE zone now has 2 branches (Maiduguri, Bauchi). Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 3.9 | 2026-03-16 | Location CRUD Admin UI + User location picker: New `Locations.razor` page at `/admin/locations` with tree view (collapsible hierarchy with icons), list view, search/filter, create/edit/activate/deactivate modals. Application layer: `LocationDtos.cs`, `LocationCommands.cs` (4 commands), `LocationQueries.cs` (5 queries). 9 handlers registered in DI. `ApplicationService` + 8 new methods. `Users.razor` updated with dynamic location picker dropdown replacing hardcoded branch list. Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.0 | 2026-03-18 | Comprehensive UI wiring audit + critical fixes + committee setup. Phase 1: Report pages wired to ReportingService (Performance + Committee); M-3 RequestBureauReportCommand migrated to ISmartComplyProvider; M-5 NonPerformingAccounts→DelinquentFacilities rename (10 files + migration); M-4 in-process concurrency lock; removed mock product fallback. Phase 2: 4 Detail tabs wired to real backend (Workflow, Advisory, Committee, Comments); DownloadDocumentAsync implemented; GetMyPendingTasksAsync fixed (Amount/ProductName); collateral mapping fixed. Phase 3: Committee voting authorization guard (role-based, 3 states); SetupCommitteeModal (2-step wizard: configure committee + add members with roles/chairperson); `CanSetupCommitteeReview` for CreditOfficer role at CommitteeCirculation status. 6 new DI registrations. Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.1 | 2026-03-18 | Standing committee infrastructure + automatic routing. New `StandingCommittee` aggregate with amount thresholds, permanent member rosters, quorum rules. `Committees.razor` admin page at `/admin/committees` with CRUD + member management. `SetupCommitteeModal` rewritten: auto-routes to matching standing committee by loan amount, pre-populates members; falls back to ad-hoc if no match. 5 standing committees seeded (Branch N0-50M, Regional N50-200M, HO N200-500M, Management N500M-2B, Board N2B+). Migration `20260318120000_AddStandingCommittees`. 8 new DI registrations. Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.2 | 2026-03-18 | Overdue functionality bug fix (5 bugs). BUG-1: NavMenu badge counts hardcoded (2,5,1) — now fetched from backend. BUG-2: ReportingService used `IsSLABreached` flag vs repository `SLADueAt < now` — aligned to use `SLADueAt < now`. BUG-3/4: `IsSLABreached` flag never set (no background job) — now irrelevant. BUG-5: NavMenu had no `OnInitializedAsync`. Added 3 count methods to ApplicationService (`GetOverdueCountAsync`, `GetMyQueueCountAsync`, `GetMyPendingVotesCountAsync`). NavMenu now loads real counts on init. Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.3 | 2026-03-18 | P3 gaps resolved. Template CRUD: `NotificationTemplateCommands.cs` (3 commands+handlers), `INotificationTemplateRepository.GetAllAsync()`, 5 DI registrations, `Templates.razor` rewrite with real backend. Bureau report detail modal: `ViewBureauReportModal.razor` (new) with accounts, fraud risk, alerts; `BureauTab.razor` OnViewReport param + view buttons; `Detail.razor` wired. Guarantor credit check trigger confirmed N/A (auto-triggered via `ProcessLoanCreditChecksCommand`). Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.4 | 2026-03-18 | Hybrid AI Advisory architecture: `RuleBasedScoringEngine.cs` (deterministic scoring), `LLMNarrativeGenerator.cs` (prompt building + OpenAI calls), `HybridAIAdvisoryService.cs` (orchestration + fallback), `AIAdvisorySettings.cs` (config). DI updated with config toggle (`UseLLMNarrative`). appsettings.json updated (API + Web.Intranet). LLM enhances narrative text only — never changes scores or recommendations. Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.5 | 2026-03-20 | Fineract Direct API integration: `IFineractDirectService` (schedule preview + customer exposure), `FineractDirectAuthHandler` (Basic Auth + tenant header), `FineractDirectService` (hybrid: Fineract API first, in-house fallback), `MockFineractDirectService` (real financial math). `FineractProductId` added to `LoanProduct` entity/DTOs/admin UI. Migration `20260320100000_AddFineractProductIdToLoanProduct`. Config: `FineractDirect` section in appsettings.json. Products admin page updated with Fineract Product ID field. Build: 0 errors, tests pass. |
| 4.7 | 2026-03-21 | Critical migration bug fix: 4 missing Designer.cs files caused EF Core to skip migrations. `IndustrySector` column absent from DB broke all loan application queries — Detail page fell back to mock data (status "HOReview"), hiding Loan Pack and Offer Letter buttons. Fixed by creating Designer.cs files, updating model snapshot, and making migrations idempotent. All 4 migrations now apply on startup. |
| 4.8 | 2026-03-22 | Bug fixes from TabModalReviewReport: (C7) Settings persistence via localStorage — `SaveSettings`/`ResetToDefaults` now read/write `localStorage["userSettings"]`. (C8) Audit trail pagination wired to `SearchAuditLogsHandler` — real `totalCount`/`totalPages`, Previous/Next buttons functional. (C-4) Null-user auth guard in Detail.razor — `EnsureAuthenticated` helper redirects to `/login` on expired session; 15 occurrences replaced. (C-5) Collateral `MarketValue`/`ForcedSaleValue` now fetched from full `CollateralDto` via `GetCollateralByIdHandler` per item. (C-6) Per-item LTV computed from real `loanAmount / acceptableValue`. Build: 0 errors. |
| 4.9 | 2026-03-22 | M-series + L-series bug fixes (all 19 M + all 8 L). M: FSV validation, committee min-approval guard, auth in SetupCommitteeModal, configurable collateral haircuts (IOptions<CollateralHaircutSettings>), FillPartyInfoModal IsValid fix, vote range validation, offer letter enum status check, BankSettings config, balance sheet validation, UpdateCollateralHandler/UpdateGuarantorHandler (new), admin pages SystemAdmin authorization, LocationId on UserSummary/Users, committee FinalDecision, overdue null SLADueAt guard, audit free-text search through all layers, dashboard demo data removed. L: AppStatus constants class — all status strings in Detail.razor replaced (CanManageValuation, CanManageGuarantors, FormatStatus, GetStatusBadgeClass, action buttons); client-side pagination (page size 15) added to Users/Products/Templates/Committees admin pages; Help page search now filters via HelpNavItems list (40 entries); AddComment loading state + error handling (CommentsTab IsSubmitting/SubmitError params); calendar month calculation fix in UploadExternalStatementModal. Build: 0 errors. |
| 4.6 | 2026-03-20 | Offer letter generation: `OfferLetter` aggregate (versioning, schedule summary). `GenerateOfferLetterCommand` + handler. `OfferLetterPdfGenerator` (QuestPDF: facility details, full repayment schedule table, conditions, acceptance section). `OfferLetterRepository` + EF config. Migration `20260320110000_AddOfferLettersTable`. Detail.razor "Offer Letter" button (Approved/Disbursed). Help page updated: new "Offer Letter" section, Operations workflow updated with offer letter step, Approved status card updated. Build: 0 errors. |
